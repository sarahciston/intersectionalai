### Attitude: Fierce & Scrappy

### Overwhelm: Languages, Tools, Libraries, Oh My


### Which tools for which jobs?

### All Programs Combine Just a Few Basic Concepts

No matter the complexity, any code is made up of these elements, and anything you want to build will be composed of these elements layered together. 

variables (labeled containers for data)
data types:
    strings (text)
    numbers (float/integer)
    groups: list, dictionary, etc. (AKA array)
    booleans: (true/false)
decisions & loops
	if/then
	for loops, while loops, etc.
functions & classes (labeled containers for actions)
modules / libraries

1. Variables & Data Types

>Variables are placeholders you can name and store information in to recall for later. Maybe you name a variable `x` and you make `x = 1` then later you can ask, "What was `x`?" or "Change `x = 3` now." 

>Data types are all the different kinds of information you can store. Some languages ask you to specify which kind of variable you're creating, like Javascript. Others, like Python, can tell just by how the data is formatted. **Strings** are simple lines of text (always seen in between quotation marks). **Integers** and **Floats** are whole numbers and decimals, respectively. There are also ways to store numbers so the computer can decode them in binary and other ways. Finally, **Booleans* are data types that are just `true` or `false`. 

>Then there are data types that group collections of data together. These are variously called lists, arrays, dictionaries, objects, sets, etc. They each have different benefits. Arrays and lists are simple rundowns of data: `list = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` or `emoji = ["peach", "eggplant", "heart"]` Dictionaries and objects have pairs of values, where each item has its own key, or "variable" so to speak, assigned to it: `dict = { "key": "value", "name": "Sarah", "color": "teal" }` And sets are special lists that forbid duplicates, which can occasionally come in handy.

>Any of the above data types can be stored in a variable that you name (almost) whatever you want.

2. Calculations & Operators

>Now that you've got some data in your program, time to do something with it! One of the main things programs do is make calculations on data using mathematical operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc. (`+ - * /`), as well as Boolean operations that act as filters, for example AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`)

3. Loops & Conditionals

> Computers can compound that calculation work at high speed and great volume, allowing for ...
> if/then and if/else

>for loops for (let i=0; i<list.length;i++){} and for (let l in list){}

>try/catch and the dreaded while loop

4. Functions & Classes
> The best part about computation is that it's designed to  make patterns to apply to multiple situations. So now that you've written all this great code, you can adapt it slightly and "save" it in a function so that you can reuse it with some other data down the line. Functions are similar to variables in that they store information, but instead of storing data like a variable would, functions can store a whole phrase that expresses an action. They can execute and act on whatever data you feed into them by using some placeholder variables that get replaced by the data you feed in when you run the function later on. Make sense yet? It will help to try an example:
