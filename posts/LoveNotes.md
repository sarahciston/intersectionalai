<section class="zine-page page-2" markdown="1">
Many, many people believe better AI futures are possible and your inspiration for IAI can draw on a wide range of practitioners already in action!

We're creating an ever-growing master list of projects, tools, resources to learn from. We'd also like to highlight and discuss a few in detail here...

<!-- >simple databases are the key to everything, separating data layer from business layer -->

<!-- refer to Creative Code Collective Hub -->
[Creative Code Collective Resource Hub](https://creativecodecollective.github.io/resource-hub/) is an interactive, sortable, more comprehensive version of this effort. Please add any and all items listed here to the CCC hub via [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PhArOS2tgxC7PgHbUy7eCFjqwGBe90QnbNuj4A51b90/edit?usp=sharing) and the zine will highlight and describe a select few as space allows.

*Wishlist...*
* Add'l Berlin spacesâ€”would love to know more!
* other international examplesâ€”would love to know more from outside US & EU!

### Beloved Readings
* Nakamura, Lisa. 2014. "Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Life." The American Studies Association. 
  >"Indian-identified traits and practices such as painstaking attention to craft and an affinity for metalwork and textiles were deployed to position the Navajo on the cutting edge of a technological moment precisely because of their possession of a racialized set of creative cultural skills in traditional, premodern artisanal handwork." (Nakamura 2014, 925)
