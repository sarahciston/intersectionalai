# Process Notes for IAI

### 2021.07.15
#### the shape of the container matters

toolkit | **care package** | compendium | index | **inventory** | database
**knapsack** | totebag | reader | omnibus | catalogue | resource
gazetteer | directory | register | roster | anthology | suite
lexicon | glossary | sewing basket | convolutes | caldron | labyrinth
tapestry | tangle | coven | web | hub | **support** network
**kit** | library/ian | jellyfish | circuit | forum | **matrix** 
zine | **portal** | knowledge base | aid society | framework | schema 
scaffolding | lattice | meshwork |  openwork... reticulation... reticule...

* inventory
  * a collection or compendium, 
  * but also a taking stock and a reckoning, 
  * and also invent-ory—what can be imagined or made new from what is
* care package
  * collected from and offered to others who are dispersed
* portal
  * connecting as in ports
  * sending through to other realms, transformation
* reticule/reticulate
  * reticulate: crossing veins, fibers, or lines as in a net or a network
  * reticule: a small handbag, drawn together with string

#### open questions, who is intersectionality 'for'?

A question I keep returning to, and will keep returning to in different forms: How best to honor the roots of Intersectionality in Black Feminism and the work of Dr. Crenshaw and so many people? Those who both saw its promise for coalition-building but also saw the specific needs their own communities faced, the ways the term has been appropriated? Shifting power to address the specific needs of folks who are multiply, intersectionally excluded can better serve everyone (and that's not the only reason we should do it, but for the common humanity we fail to see in each other, which should but all too often does not go without saying). 

More and more thinking of my practice as holding space for & communing with others work, thinking of making platforms as containers for imagination, thinking of my intersecting privileges as an imperative to apply intersectional analysis, and my intersecting margins as tools for coalition. I'm not sure, and I'm eager to reflect on this more in conversation, but I wonder if it is less about who intersectionality is for and more about what they use it for and how...

#### open questions, uncertainties

is this a toolkit, or would another term be better? There's a lot about the instrumentality of "toolkit" I don't like. 

An index? Does speak to the cataloguing process that much of this has become—and I do love alliteration. But oh, there's the already fantastic [Cyberfeminist Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/).

Previous discussions have included a suite (of tactical media), a caldron, a labyrinth, a garden, a resource hub. A collection, a gathering, an accretion. A murder of crows. A super-organism of spores. #what-would-adrienne-marie-brown-do to signal the emergence, the strategy, the community, the honoring of its multiplicitous, polyvocal parts?

#### started from the bottom now we're... back again

I scoured the entire internet for the perfect platform to write and code together, to create this making-of-a-project project, this code-zine-oroboros. And wouldn't you know it, I am back at the same freaking tool I started with ten months ago, the same template, the same questions.
