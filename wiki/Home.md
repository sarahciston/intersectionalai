# What is the Intersectional AI Toolkit?

#### A ZINE COLLECTION FOR ARTISTS, ACTIVISTS, MAKERS, ENGINEERS, AND YOU 

The Intersectional AI Toolkit gathers ideas, ethics, and tactics for more ethical, equitable tech. It shows how established queer, antiracist, antiableist, neurodiverse, feminist communities contribute needed perspectives to reshape digital systems. The toolkit also offers approachable guides to both intersectionality and AI. This endeavor works from the hope that code can feel approachable for everyone, can move us toward care and repair---rather than perpetuating power imbalances---and can do so by embodying lessons from intersectionality.

Of course, this toolkit is not the first or only resource on intersectionality or AI. Instead, it gathers together some of the
amazing people, ideas, and forces working to re-examine the foundational assumptions built into these technologies. In the tradition of '90s zine aesthetics and politics, it celebrates these radical efforts by sharing them---connecting concepts, creators, tools, and tactics across disciplines and counter-histories---hoping to spark further conversation
and collaboration. It does so imperfectly and incrementally, showing rough edges and edit marks, in the belief that no text is final, all code can be forked, and everything is better with friends.

Please join in by exploring the toolkit, commenting with your questions or thoughts, or remixing it into your own new text(s). No experience is necessary to participate; all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome!

# What's included? 

## üì† Zine collection

#### Our zine collection grows with every in-person and online **zine-making workshop** 

-   [üòç Help Me Code IAI](Code_Basics "wikilink")\'s first volume was created at the [Creative Code Collective](https://creativecodecollective.com) USC Zine-Making Workshop

### Plus these online issues are continual works-in-progress: READABLE, REMIXABLE, SHAREABLE. 

1.  üç¶üç¶ [A-to-Z IAI](Glossary "wikilink") A double-sided glossary from AI technical perspectives and social perspectives
2.  üíú [Love Notes to IAI](LoveNotes "wikilink") Great practitioners and projects already at work
3.  üî• [Why We Need IAI](WhyIAI "wikilink") Making the case for more equitable, empathic tech
4.  üå∂ [Tactics for IAI](Tactics "wikilink") Practical approaches from wide-ranging communities and decades of intersectional effort
5.  üòç [Help Me Code IAI](Code_Basics "wikilink") Afraid of programming but want to save AI from itself?
6.  ü§© [Help Me Understand Intersectionality](Intersectionality "wikilink") Why listen to academic, activist, or artistic approaches?

#### üòÅ How do I make my own zine?

![fold at solid lines, cut at center scored lines
only\|300px\|left](zineHowTo.png "fold at solid lines, cut at center scored lines only|300px|left")![refold
and pinch toward
center\|300px\|left](zineHowTo2.png "refold and pinch toward center|300px|left")

1.  fold your paper in half long ways, then unfold. 
2.  fold your paper in half short ways, then unfold. 
3.  fold the edges of your paper toward the middle, and unfold. you should have eight mini sections. 
4.  cut ONLY along the two short folds in the middle, by folding the paper in half short ways again. find the folded edge and cut only halfway in (not from the side that is open). do not cut all the way across. unfold. the goal is to have a slice in the center that does not connect to any edges. 
5.  finally, fold the paper in half long ways again so the printed side faces out. pinch open the sliced center and separate those pages apart from each other until they join their neighbors. 
6.  fold the book closed with the covers on the front and back.

### ... and it's pronounced zeen, right?

Yep, like "magazine." Like, "I'm so excited to read this zeeeeeeen!"

This wiki/zine library of digital-print hybrid zines are written for a
non-academic/non-technical audiences and are intended as practical
introductory field guides to key concepts, strategies, and resources
around inclusive, intersectional AI. But mainly they are intended as
jumping off points for your own practice, inspiration, and continued
conversation. They celebrate, cite, remix, reframe, and you should feel
welcome to do the same.

Christina Dunbar-Hester, in Hacking Diversity (2020), notes that the
perhaps surprising appearance of zines and crafting in feminist
technology circles makes sense: "In feminist zine making, forms of
knowledge like folk medicine can be filtered through the riot grrrl
practice of zine-making, which is itself connected to long traditions of
feminine papercraft and journaling. They are identity practices in
addition to circulations of knowledge" (111). As digital-print hybrids,
they can utilize the liveliest aspects of both: GIFS and images, the
expandability and nonlinearity of hyperlinks, and other dynamic content
online; but also the accessible, 'handmade', distributable, low-power
novelty of paper at a moment of maximum screen fatigue. The print
versions of these zines are formatted to print double-sided on a single
landscape page, making reversible two-part mini-zines (in multiple
combinations as the library grows).

They are also inspired by the [Tiny Tech
Zines](https://tinytechzines.org/) festival and two fantastic zines
acquired there \["Bite-Size Networking"\] by Julia Evans and \["How to
Cite Like a Badass Feminist Tech Scholar of Color"\] by Data and
Society's Rigoberto Lara Guzm√°n and Sareeta Amrute. Check out the [Who
Loves IAI](Who_Loves_IAI "wikilink") zine for other zines we love, like
the \[Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observation\].

## ü§ì Who's making this IAI TK?

Developed by Sarah Ciston while a virtual fellow at the HIIG, with
valued inspiration and collaboration from many others included on the
**[[Community]]** page. See
**[[Notes]]** for more on Sarah's making of this
collection-in-progress and read more below about how you can help it
grow.

# üòé ...and how can I contribute?

### Comment, edit, & remix this 

There are many ways to contribute. One of the most immediate is to join
in the co-creation of these texts! Feel free to read along, and add your
thoughts on the project's archive. I think of this as an expanded form
of reading-writing.

-   Pardon our dust, this section is being updated as we migrate from github to wiki format. You can also see the [github archive](https://github.com/sarahciston/intersectionalai) for past versions.

At the top of any page on this site, you'll see links to \"edit, edit
source, view history.\" When you follow these, you\'re invited to make a
user account to make edits and suggestions to any page. You can also
look at all the prior versions and compare any old version to any new
one. Don\'t worry, you can\'t break anything!

We\'ll add more instructions for working with wiki soon, including how
you can copy this entire wiki as a model to make your own wiki-zine too.

## Creative Code Collective Resource Hub 

#### THE CODE RESOURCE HUB IS AN EVER-GROWING COMMUNITY-SOURCED DATABASE OF USEFUL TUTORIALS, CODE LIBRARIES, AND INSPIRING PROJECTS --- CURATED FOR CRITICAL AND CREATIVE LEARNING 

The IAI Toolkit is closely partnered with the [Creative Code Collective
Resource Hub](https://creativecodecollective.com/resource-hub.html),
which has been curated by members of Creative Code Collective and
friends. It is an interactive, searchable, sortable database that will
point you to the many different kinds of projects, tools, and research
being made around creative coding, Intersectional AI and related topics.
It's fed by a user-friendly spreadsheet where you can add your own
resources and tell us why you like them. Get inspired and you can get
cracking making your own intersectional projects and tools for others.

## Coding.Care

Elsewhere Sarah is working on documenting the process of building the
Intersectional AI Toolkit and Creative Code Collective as an
experimental dissertation. *[Coding.Care: A Guidebook for Transformative
Processing & Tender Technocraft](https://coding.care)* is a how-to guide
to creating and sustaining communities around critical-creative code.
What values and strategies does it take to support those creating
intersectional approaches to tech? Plus, lessons learned and strategies
gained from growing Creative Code Collective.
