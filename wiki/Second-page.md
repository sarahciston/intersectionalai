## What Intersectionality Means to Me {#what_intersectionality_means_to_me}

### And me, and me, and me too 

### Bringing the marginalized back to the center 

### I want to get it but \...

### If you\'re wondering, \"Why should I have to get it?\"

#### Questions to answer in this section: 

![AI To-Do
List\|400px\|right](LC-AIToDoList.png "AI To-Do List|400px|right")

-   Why listen to academic, activist, or artistic approaches?
-   Why take a specifically intersectional approach?
-   Why does considering multiple perspectives and different identities matter so much for thinking about technology?
-   Why attach such convoluted-seeming phrases to these ideas, and what do they even mean?
-   Why a print zine or a digital platform where anyone can contribute?
-   Whose responsibility is it to make the effort to learn, to try harder? (The difference between barriers to access and privileged discomfort.)

> \"Many artists sought to provoke audiences by defamiliarizing the

> Other artists described deploying defamiliarization to mobilize

> \"As a tactic, destabilizing and defamiliarizing the audience in the
> service of politicizing aesthetics predates digital computing.
> \[\...\] Benjamin argues that revolutionary artists must juxtapose
> tactics provoking both destabilization and reflection in order to
> awaken a progressive political consciousness in their audience.\"
> (Stark & Crawford 2019, 447)[^3]

> \"Many artists also noted concrete plans for educating and
> contextualizing were vital to the ethics of their art practice.\"
> (Stark & Crawford 2019, 448)[^4]

> \"many of the artists we interviewed also claimed that the mantle of
> "artist" meant working in a space of social and even legal exception.
> \[\...\] These tensions animated many artists' sense of their own
> ethical process.\" (Stark & Crawford 2019, 449)[^5]

> \"artists are the vanguard of exploring the ethical, political, and
> aesthetic potential of emerging technologies and in recognizing the
> interconnection between the techniques of artistic production and
> their political effects.\" (Stark & Crawford 2019, 450)[^6]

> \"The experience of artists reinforces a point we have each separately
> argued elsewhere: that abstract ethics conversations are a necessary
> but not sufficient condition for progressive politics around digital
> technologies and that everyday digital practice is the terrain around
> which broader ethical and political ends must be staked out.\" (Stark
> & Crawford 2019, 452) \"artists saw value in reaching shared normative
> practices through engagement between artists and audiences, suggesting
> a model for participation and collaboration often missing in other
> forms of digital research and development.(Stark & Crawford 2019,
> 452)[^7]

> \"An ethics of ambiguity confronts artists with the responsibilities
> of autonomous choice and its consequences; defamiliarization is the
> formal outcome that best translates this ethical impulse to the
> audience, prompting reflection and heightened presence of mind. The
> conscious bundling of the aesthetic and the ethical in the minds of
> artists we interviewed was what kept this twinned impulse politically
> emancipatory, along with the expression of this connection in both
> social interactions and formal critiques.\" (Stark & Crawford 2019,
> 451)[^8]
